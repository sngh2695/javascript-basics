let x;

// Undefined is a datatype in javascript.A variable having no values has undefined as value and its of type undefined.

let y=null;
console.log(y);
console.log(typeof y);

// Null is an object in javascript.A variable having null as value is of type object

console.log(x==y);

// Since both null and undefined means nothing as a value hence they both are equal in terms of value

console.log(x===y);

// Since undefined is a data type and null is of type object,they both have different datatypes


/* 
Null: It is the intentional absence of the value. It is one of the primitive values of JavaScript.

Undefined: It means the value does not exist in the compiler. It is the global object.
